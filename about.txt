One thing i learned from GitHub: GitHub is used to faster feedback loops.
Why this matters
Reviewable & Traceable
Keeping PRs small ensures reviewers can understand the changes quickly and with confidence. It also simplifies tracing the cause of issues down the line.

Safer Rollbacks
If something goes wrong, having only one feature or fix in a PR makes it easy to revert without collateral damage.

Faster Feedback Loops
Short PRs mean less waiting and faster merges, which helps maintain project momentum and boosts morale
